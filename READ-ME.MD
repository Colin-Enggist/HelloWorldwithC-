## Installation
    To Install and run the Programm took me quite some time because with MSYS2.

    With the help from the following link I was able to set up my enviroment to be able to learn C++
        https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp

## Purpose

    Well it's pretty obvious that this is my first time working with C++ and that I am learning the language. 
    
    At work I often use Html, Javascript, Css and Typescript. At the time I do a lot of Front-End developement. 
    My job is pretty unique and as far as I know the only place where you find Mediamatiker is in Switzerland. We are somewhat a mixture of Graphical Designers, Multimedia per se and Web-developers. Naturally because of that the job's we apply for are heavily influenced by our portfolio and our strengths. 

    My goal is to go a little further than just Web-developement and I want to be able to not only design for applications on various devices but also to be able to programm them. 

    For that I can say I'm just one of those guys that really loves to work creatively but next to that I am also a massive nerd that loves to learn new concepts and I can spend hours to really understand and improve my code.
    
    Next to that I also Play Video Games and always had an interest for game design and developement.

## What I learned

    - I learned how to set-up my enviroment for C++
    - I learned how to compile a .cpp file and how to run my Code in the Terminal with ./Filename
